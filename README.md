# iSLEEP
# This project introduces a prototype IoT device, a smart sleep tracker that collects and analyses the sleep statistics of the subject, and provides collated data on demand. 
# It also monitors the environment of user like temperature to help correlate the sleep issues with possible physical conditions. 
# It further demonstrates easy integration of other smart devices like smart thermostat to control these physical aspects like modifying the room temperature more efficiently to help better sleep based on collected statistics.
# The data captured from the composition of virtual sleep sensor and temperature sensor is sent to server in a power efficient manner using MQTT with differential publish mechanism.
